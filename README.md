split audio_segmentation with corresponding transcript for youtube datasets 


how can i handle youtube dataset with the indian accent. then segmented with a correct transcript?

i was downloading .mp3 playlist for youbute indian speakers with .vtt subtitle file.

.vtt file format like starting-ending timing with the audio transcript.
i was segmenting that youtube audiofile with Start-End time.

and i applied some preprocessing like data cleaning, wav file format 16bit 16khz mono, and then use it deepspeech training.
